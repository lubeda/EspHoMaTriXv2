## 2023.8.0

A lot of users asked for special behavior, e.g. display date but no time or vice versa. Display nothing at all e.g. during night. I like to implement a lot of the requests but it's hard to keep the known default behaviour. In this version i will provide a YAML with the default behaviour but there will be less hardcoded by me, instead you have your freedom to do  all in your YAML.

For the old default behavior use this trigger in your YAML:

```yaml
  on_empty_queue:
    then:
      lambda: |-
        id(rgb8x32)->clock_screen(10,10);
        id(rgb8x32)->date_screen(10,5);
  on_start_running:
     then:
       lambda: |-
          id(rgb8x32)->bitmap_screen("[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63519,63519,63519,63519,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63519,0,0,0,0,2016,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63488,0,63488,0,0,0,63519,0,0,0,0,2016,2016,0,0,0,65514,0,65514,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,64512,0,0,64512,0,63488,63488,0,63488,63488,0,0,63519,63519,63519,0,0,2016,0,2016,0,65514,0,65514,0,65514,0,31,31,31,0,0,0,64512,64512,0,0,63488,63488,63488,63488,63488,0,0,63519,0,0,0,0,2016,0,2016,0,65514,0,65514,0,65514,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,64512,64512,0,0,0,63488,63488,63488,0,0,0,63519,63519,63519,63519,0,2016,0,2016,0,65514,0,65514,0,65514,0,0,0,31,31,0,64512,0,0,64512,0,0,0,63488,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]",1,10);
          id(rgb8x32)->bitmap_small("[2016,0,0,0,2016,0,0,0,2016,0,0,0,2016,0,0,0,2016,0,0,0,2016,0,0,0,0,2016,0,2016,0,31,31,0,0,0,2016,0,31,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,31,31,31]", "2023.x.y", 1, 10);
          id(rgb8x32)->clock_screen(10,10);
          id(rgb8x32)->date_screen(10,5);
```

The `on_start_running`-trigger is called after the device boot once. The `on_empty_queue`-trigger is called when there is nothing in the queue. With the examples you will always have a clock and date displayed. If you don't like or want other colors e.t.c. feel free the change your YAML and have fun.

If you don't add this trigger you have a blank display until your hosts add screens via service calls.
