# Broken Ulanzi TC-001?

**Skill-level:** extreme

There are some known issues regarding the voltage regulator of the 2023 March batch of Ulanzi TC-001 clocks.  It appears that the LDO voltage regulator may be defective and if it burns out, may need replacing.

Your best bet is to contact the seller or Ulanzi directly for a replacement unit.

But some folks over at the Awtrix [github forum](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix-light/issues/67) and [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/546407049148366859/1096822468737511574/1101222937501126778) say the regulator can be replaced with a STI3408B.

Good luck!
